# 🌟 Facebook-like Social Media Platform 🌟

## 📖 Introduction

This project is a **Facebook-inspired social media platform**, built entirely in **C++**, offering a command-line simulation of popular social media features. It showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation** to create a scalable and modular application.

Dive into this project to explore how core functionalities of a social media platform—such as posts, pages, user interactions, and timelines—come to life!
